H0	: There is no significant difference between global north and global south in how material consumption relates to health and emissions.
H1	: In the global north, higher material footprint per capita is strongly associated with better health outcomes but also higher emissions, while in the global south the trade-off is weaker (lower consumption but also lower emissions).

The alternate hypothesis can also be split further into the following:

H1a	: In Global North countries, higher per capita material consumption is positively associated with better health outcomes.
H1b	: In Global North countries, higher per capita material consumption is positively associated with higher GHG emissions.
H1c	: In Global South countries, these associations are weaker or less pronounced.
